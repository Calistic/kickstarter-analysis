# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kistarter data to uncover trends

## Summary

## Reasonable Conclusions from the Data

* Regarding Theater: May is the best month to have run a fundraiser. December is the worst month to run a fundraiser.
  - Assumptions: This could be caused by shorter days. Unfortunately there is not enough data from the southern hemisphere (more daylight in December) to compare to the northern hemisphere. This could also be caused by December being in the middle of the "holiday season". Perhaps people prioritize other charities/fundraisers. 

* Regarding Plays: Fundraisers with a goal less than $5,000 have the highest success rate, 76%. Fundraisers with a goal between $45,000 and $50,000 have the lowest success rate, 0%.

* Regarding Plays: The top 2 fundraisers raised more than the lowest 509 fundraisers. It would be a worthy time investment to understand why these two fundraisers performed this well.

## Limitations and suggestions for additional tables of graphs

* Another column should be added to the main table that converts all currencies to the same currency, probably USD. The Outcomes Based on Goals chart could be extremely misleading if USD and KRW (Korean Won) are plotted on the same Success/Fail/Canceled line. Note: $1 = â‚©1163.73.

* As mentioned earlier, we need more data from the southern hemisphere. This would help us understand why December is a bad fundraising month.

* It would be very useful to determine if large fundraisers are worth pursuing. Despite their higher failure rate they may raise significant cash.  A graph that plots amount raised vs. goal would help determine the best balance of small, medium, and large campaigns to run.
